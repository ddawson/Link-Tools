  mobile links, extract identifiers, or change to alternate domains.
* Operations to copy things to the clipboard and to visit links.
* Can operate on links in the page (right-click) and the page address.
* Can decode embedded links (provided a pattern is known), exposing them
  to all copy and visit operations.

  derived directly from given links).

  importing and exporting them.
